# Welcome user


Hello and welcome to my Python calculator.
This is a Tiknter  program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
You can also use parentheses to change the order of operations and decimals to work with fractions.
To use this calculator, you just need to enter a valid mathematical expression and press the equal button.
The program will evaluate the expression and display the result.
If you want to exit the program, you can simply exit the window with the classic way.
I hope you enjoy using my Python calculator and find it useful. Thank you for your attention.
